### Cluster name

Use a stack specific, non-default, cluster name

### Bucket names

Require a bucketname in a vars file to ensure they are distinct.

### Tags

In the ASG module wrapper add the local variables to the null resource that adds
the tags. They are not currently being added.

Check for hard coded tag values on resources. All should be `local` or via additional_tags

### Size

Make the instance bigger


## Modules

### RDS Module

We are not using the [Terraform RDS module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/rds/aws/1.15.0)
due to the [Can't pass an already existing db_subnet_group](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-rds/issues/48#issuecomment-374250014)
issue. Instead we will use our own code.

## SG module

Rewrite it to use base SG resources for the same reason as above. You can
only add one instance of the module on each run otherwise you hit the count issue.

## Services

### Node exporter
